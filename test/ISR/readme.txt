These are ISR's to be used when testing.

You may need to pick and choose by excluding some ISR's from the build.
That is, the ISR's may be specific to some test and not general for all tests.
For example, there may be two files, both ISR's for Port 1, where each handles an interrupt on a different Port 1 pin.
