/*
 * Voltage measurement using ADC.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - measure Vcc in centiVolts
 * - measure proportion of V on external pin to various references
 * -- 1.5VBG
 * -- Vcc
 * - configure resources ( VBG, ADC and pin multiplexing) to support the above.
 *
 * A proper use of these routines can leave all GPIO's in their original use.
 * TODO disable VBG to save power?
 * The ADC will not draw power when not being sampled.
 *
 * To use this requires:
 * - certain sequences of method calls
 * - certain timings
 * See algebra below.
 *
 * Algebra:
 *
 * In general the sequence is configure(), delay() or wait(), read(), unconfigure()
 *
 * When measuring Vcc: measureVccCentiVolts()
 * no GPIO is altered, a slight internal delay, and no resources active afterwards.
 *
 * When measuring external pin versus 1.5V: measureExternalPinProportionTo1_5VBG();
 * slight internal delay
 * no delay for pin signal to stabilize
 * GPIO left in original configuration
 *
 *
 * When measuring an external pin dedicated to a signal (and with no sleep that would reset configuration):
 * Sequence: configure() (once), read(), read(), ...
 *
 * When measuring an external pin that is multiplexed with GPIO:
 * Sequence: configure(), delay() (for signal to stabilize) , read(),..., read(), unconfigure(), <use pin for GPIO>
 *
 * Unconfiguration can be moot when you are entering LPMx.5, which resets configuration anyway.
 *
 * 8-bit resolution only.
